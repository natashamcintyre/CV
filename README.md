## About Me :wave:

Collaborative, resilient and adaptable, I am a full stack software developer with a passion for solving problems and creating effective and simple solutions. I enjoy puzzles, challenge, languages and learning, and I apply creativity, curiousity and attention to detail to my work. I believe in building well-tested products, balancing high-quality code with speed, that deliver business and client value.
