## Experience :owl:

**Nested Estate Agent** (May 2021 to present)
_Software Engineer_

Very proud of my progress at Nested, I have risen to multiple challenges whether technical, team or business related, as evidenced in my performance reviews and promotions. Working in agile, cross-functional teams in multiple formats and sizes, I successfully lead features, collaborating and facilitating decision making, overseeing the build and using retrospectives to reflect, share and receive feedback both for my learning and the team's growth. I review code in consideration of best practices, using the discussion to generate learning opportunities, and am mentoring a peer in their first role as a product engineer. I am also leading the tech strategy initiative, I deliver learning sessions internally and at an external Elixir training day, and I have attended conferences to expand my knowledge and network. Some examples of my technical achievements include:

- Created a new database, backfilled and ported data accurately and transitioned the app across to simplify and solve a duplication issue with the least impact on the end user.
- Successfully led a timeline feature in the CRM which involved complex queries of multiple databases and sorting chronologically
- Implemented pagination for a costly query to reduce wait time for the user and the load on the database.
- Built an animated list component which slides up and down as new items are added and removed.
- Upgraded multiple dependencies to reduce security issues.
- Implemented storybook successfully to improve documentation. Aimed to simplify the process for future developers adding stories.
